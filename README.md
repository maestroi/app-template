## How to use it

To create a new project from scratch, fork this repository on GitHub, rename it, and clone it:

```bash
git clone <the path to your fork>
```

Or do a [custom setup](#custom-setup)!

## Build and run

To get started, setup everything and get all dependencies with yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

Run a development server that watches the project files,
compiles them on demand and hot-reloads the changes to keep your browser in sync:

```bash
yarn serve
```

Lint your code, i.e. make it beautiful automagically:

```bash
yarn lint
```

Run your unit tests:

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

Compile and minify the project to be ready for deploying in production:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Custom setups

Custom setups allow you to add features to an existing project,
or hand-pick the features you need. For advanced users!

### Super-charge an existing repo

Turn your existing repo into a Nimiq app with Vue by adding the template code:

```bash
git remote add template git@github.com:nimiq/app-template.git
git fetch template
git merge template/master
```

Or...

### Create a new repo locally (for nerds)

```bash
Mkdir my-app
Cd my-app
Git init
```

... continue with the commands from the  [previous step](#super-charge-an-existing-repo).

### Handpick the features you like (for super nerds!)

To only add some of the features,
checkout [this list](https://github.com/nimiq/app-template/commits/master).
Each commit represents one feature.

Now, instead of getting all features with `git merge template/master` as used before,
copy the commit ID up to which you want to add features to your project and then merge up to that point only:

```bash
git merge <commit ID>
```

**Note:** Cherry-picking features might work in some cases
 but is not recommended as some features built upon others from before.

### Customize the Vue.js configuration

See [Vue.jsâ€™s configuration reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/) for details.
